# TFG_Garotes

This project was developed within Garotes, an initiative by Spascat to create bathymetric maps of hard to reach coastal areas using satellite-derived algorithms. Since these models require calibration with real data and the company lacked an autonomous, low-cost, and efficient collection method we designed a complete, accessible, and scalable solution.
The system is a radio-controlled surface drone equipped with sonar, supported by two key elements: an intermediate communication module using a custom long-range RF protocol and BLE, and a mobile application for control, telemetry, and real-time data access. With over 1 km of range, 6 hours of autonomy, and optimized electronics to minimize costs, the system offers an efficient alternative to conventional bathymetric methods.
