# TFG_Garotes

The project is situated within Garotes, an initiative by Spascat to generate bathymetric maps in hard-to-reach coastal areas using satellite-derived bathymetry algorithms. To calibrate them, a small amount of real bathymetric data is needed. The challenge was that the company did not have its own method to collect this data autonomously, economically, and efficiently.

The solution: we designed a complete, accessible, and scalable system for collecting real bathymetric data in complex environments, minimizing costs and resources. This is a marine surface vehicle controlled via radio, with integrated sonar and controllable from a mobile device application developed specifically for the project.

The developed system consists of three main components:

• A radio-controlled marine surface drone equipped with sonar, responsible for data collection.
• An intermediate communication module, linking the vehicle with the mobile device using a custom long-range radiofrequency protocol and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
• A mobile application, from which the operator can control the drone, view telemetry, and access the collected data, all in real time.

The system enables operation in hard-to-reach areas with a range greater than 1 km and an autonomy of 6 hours, and its electronic infrastructure is optimized to reduce investment, offering an efficient and economical alternative to conventional bathymetric methods.
